Accounts will be held in "accounts" database.

When a message arrives from SMS to Matrix, the following info are available to this app, and are used in choosing the destination space/room and Matrix sender.
 - Content (Matches regex)
 - Sender name (Matches regex)
Instead of implementing additional conditions, there will be regex helpers.
There will be SendAction table named "send_action", which instructs how the message should be sent. This table contains the following:
 - ID
 - Sender ID (Foreign key from Accounts table)
 - Room/Space ID
 - Name format
   Name format is nullable string that is set to null if the previous field is a room ID.
   If the given ID is of a space, this is not null.
   This string has %1 and %2 in it, each representing sender phone number and sender name.
   Both doesn't have to be in this string, but this is used to create room name within that space.
   Example: %2 (%1) -> John Doe (6643231482)
Conditions will be stored in "conditions" database, and will contain the following:
 - Content regex (null = any)
 - Sender regex (null = any)
 - Priority (lower = higher priority)
 - Send action ID (Foreign key from SendAction table)
Conditions will be loaded sorted by priority, and the send action ID in the first match will be used to send message via Matrix.
