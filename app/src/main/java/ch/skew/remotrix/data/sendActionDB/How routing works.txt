Accounts will be held in "accounts" database.

When a message arrives from SMS to Matrix, the following info are available to this app, and are used in choosing the destination space/room and Matrix sender.
 - Content (Matches regex)
 - Sender name (Matches regex)
Instead of implementing additional conditions, there will be regex helpers.

There will be SendAction table named "send_action", which instructs how the message should be sent. This table contains the following:
 - ID
 - Sender ID (Foreign key from Accounts table)
 - Space ID (Cannot be room ID)
 - Name format
Name format string has %1 and %2 in it, each representing sender phone number and sender name.
Both doesn't have to be in this string, but this is used to create room name within that space.
Example: %2 (%1) -> John Doe (6643231482)

Conditions will be stored in "conditions" database, and will contain the following:
 - Content regex (null = any)
 - Sender regex (null = any)
 - Priority (lower = higher priority)
 - Send action ID (Foreign key from SendAction table)
 - Reformat pattern
Conditions will be loaded sorted by priority, and the send action ID in the first match will be used to send message via Matrix, or to process the message.
If reformat patter is set, then the message is reformatted according to the format included. This uses captured values from Content regex and Sender regex.
If Send action is null but not reformat pattern, then the message is transformed and is used against next condition's Content regex.
If reformat pattern is null, message is sent via Matrix or passed down to the next condition with no modification.
If a message matches a condition and both Send action ID and Reformat pattern are null, then the message is dropped.
