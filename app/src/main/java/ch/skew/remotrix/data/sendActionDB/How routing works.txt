Accounts will be held in "accounts" database.

When a message arrives from SMS to Matrix, the following info are available to this app, and are used in choosing the destination space/room and Matrix sender.
 - Content (Matches regex)
 - Sender name (Matches regex)
Instead of implementing additional conditions, there will be regex helpers.

RoomID contains the following:
 - SMS sender phone number
 - Room ID
 - Account ID
This is automatically generated for every unique pair of Account ID and SMS phone number.

SendAction has been greatly simplified. SendAction contains the following:
 - SMS sender regex
 - SMS body regex
 - Priority
 - Account ID (may be null)
 - ID
If SMS sender and body regex matches, the account associated with the account ID will be used to send the message via Matrix.
Room to send this message is determined by roomId table.
If Account ID is null, message is not forwarded.
